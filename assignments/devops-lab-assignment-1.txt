Assignment #1

One of the requirements is to learn adequate scripting and programming to be 
able to solve routine data-related problems. You are expected to learn Linux commands, BASH scripting, and Python for systems administration/management.

The following is a sample assignment just to get you off the ground. You must 
set practice projects such as these for yourself and gain confidence.

(1) Inspect the output of the command 'ps -ef'. Use grep to detect if there are
    processes with names starting with 'chrome' and 'firefox'
(2) For each of the process identified in step (1) above, use 'cut' or 
    equivalent command to project its process id.
(3) Kill each of the process selected in step (2) above.
##
(4) Each tab in Google Chrome browser is an independent process. Write a shell
    script to terminate the process that corresponds to a particular tab in the
    browser.
(5) Taking 'home' directory as the root, recursively enumerate all files with 
    extensions matching '.pdf' or '.txt' that were created a week ago (or some 
    arbitrary time, for that matter).
##
(6) What is the official/documented way to install a new Python module in the
    system?
(7) What purpose does the '/proc' file system in Linux serve? Use your
    imagination and suggest two ideas that may be pretty useful in your own
    case. Could you write a shell script to achieve the same?
##
(8) Have you installed both Python 2.7.X and 3.2.X in your machine? How would 
    you set up your computer to have a side-by-side installation of both
    versions of Python (so you can test your programs on both platforms)?
(9) Use a container (virtualization) technology such as OpenVZ (which is pretty
    lightweight) and use separate containers to host different versions of
    Python.
##
(10) Use your imagination and originality to grow the list.
