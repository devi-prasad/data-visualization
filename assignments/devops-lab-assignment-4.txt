Assignment #4.

Collect the marks obtained by each student of your batch (first semester, 'big 
data and data analysis' program) in all five courses.

(1) What visualization would you propose and create in order to present an 
    overall picture of the academic performance? You must be able to logically 
    argue about the methodical choices you have made.
(2) How would you present the average performance of the batch?
(3) Would you compare your batch's performance with that of, say, the students 
    in the 'embedded systems' program? How would you take into account the 
    difference in the population size?
(4) What inferences would you draw from the performances of students in your 
    batch, across five different courses?
