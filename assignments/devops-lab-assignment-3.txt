Assignment #3

Randomly select six or seven computers in the laboratory (including your own 
computer), and copy the browsing history from each of the Web browser installed 
on that machine. (If three Web browsers are installed on a computer, copy the 
browsing history from all three browsers). Make sure that you have at least 
five days worth of browsing history for each machine.

(1) Sort the data according to domain names. Measure interesting parameters and 
    develop an equally interesting visualization.
(2) If you run the same experiment across labs in SOIS, can you draw definitive 
    inferences about the browsing habits or practices of users?
(3) Is there a correlation between domain names and the purpose of the lab?
(4) What graphs would you create to effectively convey this information?
