Assignment #2.

Retrieve the date and time of all commits, and the corresponding commit (text) 
messages, for each of the following three repositories (aka the population):
    https://github.com/sois/sap-efrei-spring-2016
    https://github.com/sois/moderndatabases-monsoon16
    https://github.com/sois/data-visualization

You may assume that you are working on the (checked-out) local repositories. 
Use simple commands such as 'git log' to collect the required data. You are NOT
expected to use any APIs or external libraries, and such.

Analyze the population data, and answer the following questions:
(1) what is the average length (in number of characters) of commit messages?
(2) What is the average word count in commit messages.
(3) What are the most frequently used words in the commit messages?
(4) Do weekdays witness more commits than weekends? 
(5) Do mid-week days witness more or less commits?
(6) If you do a regression analysis, what inferences would you draw?

(A) You must create a visualization for each ot these question. 
(B) You should be able to check how far the visualizations agree with the 
    statistical inferences.
