(axes, axes markers, and legends) as a reference for the problem defined below. 

(1) Manually copy the data in the table to a CSV file. Use pandas API to import 
this CSV file into your program.

(2) Use the imported data and generate small-multiples of bar chart for 
five years (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012) separately.
